# Computer_Programming_for_BME

This was a project I completed in my Computer Programming for Biomedical Engineering class. In this project, I analyzed magnetic resonance imaging data of blood flow from the heart. I had to complete steps such as smoothing the data, identifying the peaks and troughs based on various characteristics, dividing the data into cycles, and computing the areas of the flow cycles.

Major concepts that were reinforced in this project were:
- How to transition from a concept to robust code and handle edge cases (this was used especially in detecting the peaks and troughs; for example, some peaks did not have a trough prior to them).
- How to implement various mathematical concepts in MATLAB, such as the trapezoidal rule.
- How to do various types of graphing, such as creating histograms, in MATLAB.

In addition to my code, the project instructions and data are included.
